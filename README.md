# ASP DotNet Version used is 6.2.3

# React Version is 18.1.0

# Things to keep in mind
whichever route starts with /api will be directed to .NET Api code
rest of all the routes will give react static files 

# Change Project Name after Clonning
Change Root Folder Name and .csproj file name and .vscode directory, 

after that run dotnet restore to generate bin and obj folder, also when opening with vs code you will get your .vscode directory back with new project name
